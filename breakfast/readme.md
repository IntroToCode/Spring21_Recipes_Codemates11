# Smoothie

## Servings: 
1 - 2 servings 

## Time to prepare: 
5 minutes

## Ingredients:
Base Formula:
* 1 cup plain, unsweetened dairy or non-dairy milk (almond milk highly recommended)
* 1 cup loosely packed fresh baby greens (spinach, kale, etc.)
* 1 frozen banana
* 1 cup frozen fruit (berries, peaches, pineapple, mango, etc.)

Optionals Add-ins
* 1/2 cup Greek yogurt (adds probiotics, creaminess, and healthy fats)
* 2 tablespoons nut butters, nuts, or seeds (adds health fats)
* 1-2 tablespoons nutrition boosts (protein powder, greens powders, etc.)
* Sweetener, to taste (honey, maple syrup, stevia)

## Equipment needed:
1 Blender

## Steps for preparation:
1- Add unsweetened dairy or non-dairy milk (almond milk)
2- Add in packed fresh baby greens or any fibrous foods
3- Add in your frozen banana
4- Add any fresh or frozen fruits or veggies youâ€™d like to use.
5- Top it off with your favorite nutrition mix-ins.
6- Blend away

### Notes:
If you don't like bananas, try these substitutions:

1- Subbing in 1/2 cup additional plain Greek yogurt (to add creaminess), plus 1 tablespoon additional sweetener and a handful of ice cubes in place of the frozen banana in these recipes.
2- Other options: canned pineapple, sweetened yogurt, canned pears. Adding half a ripe avocado can really help make up for the creaminess that bananas usually add, too. 

Be sure to wash out the blender immediately after making your smoothie for easier cleaning.

Take 10 minutes to rest after this great breakfast.
