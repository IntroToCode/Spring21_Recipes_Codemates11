1⁄2 pound (226 grams) white mushrooms, wiped clean, trimmed and cut in half if large
1 large shallot or medium onion, cut into 8 wedges, rinsed and patted dry
4 garlic cloves, unpeeled
8 sprigs fresh rosemary8 sprigs fresh thyme
Fine sea salt and freshly ground pepper
6 tablespoons (90 ml) extra-virgin olive oil 
4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
4 whole chicken legs (thigh and drumstick), patted dry

## Equipment needed:
1 oven, one sheetpan or roasting pan,
1 large bowl
1 meat thermometer 

## Steps for preparation:
1. Put the potatoes, mushrooms, shallot or onion and garlic in a large bowl. 
2. Toss in 4 sprigs each of the rosemary and thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, a few grindings of pep- per, 3 tablespoons of the oil and 3 tablespoons of the balsamic. 
3. Mix everything well and spread the ingredients out on the baking sheet.
4. Put the chicken in the bowl, along with the remain- ing 3 tablespoons oil and 2 tablespoons balsamic,
1⁄2 teaspoon salt and a good amount of pepper, and mix well to coat the chicken. 
5. Move the vegetables around to make room for the chicken. 
6. Tuck the remaining herbs under each piece.
7. Roast the chicken for 40 minutes to 1 hour, until a thermometer stuck into the thickest part of a thigh measures 165 degrees F.
8. Serve everything on the baking sheet or a big platter; pour over the cooking juices.


### Notes:
The supper is best served straight from the oven, but leftovers are good for a couple of days; cover and refrigerate. If you’ve got a few potatoes left over, cut them into cubes and toss them into a salad.
You can use bone in breasts if you would like to use chicken breast.
